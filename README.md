# Awesome learning
It's time to branch out your skills!
Check out these *exclusviely free* courses :)

This took a while for me to make and I would really appreciate it if you starred this repository :D

You can learn how computers work, learn any modern popular language to control a computer, learn any framework for their corresponding languages and subsequently build something awesome!

I have tried to include tutorials that both teach the languages and frameworks but also included project walk throughs so that you can build something awesome straight from the get go, without getting lost and helping to apply the knowledge that you've just learnt.

# Languages
 Here is a list of every programming language you would probably ever want to learn, there may be more programming languages added in the future but there are already many of the most widely used and some more obscure ones too! Have fun learning in a variety of ways with videos, websites and books.
 
## C
C is an incredibly old language and has been around since the 1970s! It is known for being reliable and extremely fast when compared with other languages. C can be quite difficult for beginners and I do not advise that you start out with C as your first language.

# Game programming
Arguably what brings a lot of recreational programmers to programming is the idea of creating their very own game! Luckily, most of the hard work has been done already and almost anybody can create a game, both 3d and 2d! Here are some engines and libraries to help you build a game!

## Unity
Unity is a game engine developed that can be used to build 3d and 2d games and can be deployed to mobile, desktop, VR and the web.

## Piston / Amethyst
Piston is similar to Pygame however it is for Rust and is considerably faster. You can use Piston and Amethyst to make very good games and is great if you want to write games that are perhaps a bit more professional. You can make both 3D and 2D games with them however it is not as powerful as an engine such as Unreal, Unity or Godot.

# Mobile development
Mobile phones are everywhere and the majority of people on planet earth use them. Many companies have apps, many independent organisations have apps and it has become a critical and important industry to be involved in.

## Flutter
Flutter is an incredibly useful platform to build both Android and iOS apps that run quickly. It was written by Google and uses Dart, a language with syntax similar to Javascript. Flutter is an alterantive to writing different applications for different platforms.

## iOS
If you plan to write your applications purely for iOS, you can use xcode and swift to write them. However, you will need an Apple device in order to develop for the iPhone, if you don't have an Apple device and still want to build applications for this platform then try using alternative frameworks in this list.

[Video: Your first iOS app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09TeUXjzpKs)

Here are a few different frameworks with varying difficulty that allow you to build your very own desktop application that you can show off to your friends and family!

## Qt
Qt is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces and cross-platform applications that run on various platforms. It allows the developer to write native application with native capabilities and performance which many other frameworks do not offer.

# Code management
Code management is vital in every area of the industry. It is expected if you are working in a programming job that you at least know Git. Not to worry, there are plenty of cool tutorials and guides and websites to aid you in your journey to allow yourself to be employed, work with other programmers and contribute to some of your favourite software!

## Docker
Docker is a way to distribute software in containers which are isolated from one another and have their own software, libraries and configuration files. They are great for setting up a testing environment or for isolating different instances such as development and staging.

## Git
Git is a version control system (VCS) that allows the programmer to keep track of his work when updating it. It provides statistics and allows the programmer to easily rollback in case of any issues. It also allows other developers to work on the project at the same time. The majority of software uses Git and it is a vital skill.

# Ethical hacking
Many companies take security very seriously and a breach of security and data leak can lead to a ton of lawsuits and legal, ethical and moral problems. Companies hire ethical hackers and pentesters to test the resilience of their applications to see if they can find a way in and help make the companies applications indestructible and unhackable! Learn the ways in these simple guides below.

## General ethical hacking
Learn the basics of ethical hacking.

[Video: Gophish tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6S5JF6Gou0)

## Linux
Linux is an operating system just like macOS or Windows that can be easily used to program on, pentest on and do pretty much anything. It is a solid alternative to Windows and allows people who love customisation and knowing a lot about their computer to tweak and program to their hearts content. It is also faster and more secure and private than Windows. It also is more or less immune to computer viruses.

[Video: Linux for ethical hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAoFs75_cs)

## Pentesting
Pentensting or Penetration Testing is a term used to define the act of testing the security and resilience of a system. Pentesting doesn't require a knowledge of programming or software, they just need to know the areas useful to security.

## Talks and lectures
Here are some talks and lectures on ethical hacking and pentesting to see how it can be used and examples of where it has been used. Including in non-ethical ways.

# Databases and Query languages
Databases are arguably one of the most boring parts of programming. Having to store data in the correct way and in a way that is fast and can be accessed without getting hacked is pretty difficult. Luckily there are plenty of tutorials and guides that teach you how to maintain, structure, manage and use a database in your applications!

## Database design

# Esoteric languages
Esoteric languages are fun little languages to play around with when you are bored or just want to try something different or quirky. From languages that only consist of a limited number of characters to languages that are 100% emojis, these languages are quite interesting and test the limits of what a programming language really is. You are highly unlikely to get a job in these languages but they are great fun!

## Brainfuck
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that is notable for its extreme minimalism. It consists of only 8 commands and is not inteded for practical use.
