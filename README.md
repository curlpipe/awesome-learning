# Languages
 Here is a list of every programming language you would probably ever want to learn, there may be more programming languages added in the future but there are already many of the most widely used and some more obscure ones too! Have fun learning in a variety of ways with videos, websites and books.
 
## C
C is an incredibly old language and has been around since the 1970s! It is known for being reliable and extremely fast when compared with other languages. C can be quite difficult for beginners and I do not advise that you start out with C as your first language.
