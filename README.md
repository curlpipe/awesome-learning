# Languages
 Here is a list of every programming language you would probably ever want to learn, there may be more programming languages added in the future but there are already many of the most widely used and some more obscure ones too! Have fun learning in a variety of ways with videos, websites and books.
 
## C
C is an incredibly old language and has been around since the 1970s! It is known for being reliable and extremely fast when compared with other languages. C can be quite difficult for beginners and I do not advise that you start out with C as your first language.

## C++
C++ is a language in the C family and is therefore known to be fast and well established within the language sphere. Originally released in 1985, it now has uses such as game creation and running on embedded systems. It is not a great place to start out as a beginner due to its huge amount of special syntax rules but good to move onto at a later date.

## R
R is a language that is primarily for statistical computing and graphics that is used amongst statisticians and data miners and can be used for data analysis. It serves a specific purpose and serves a very specific area of programming. If you are looking to start off programming, try learning a general-purpose language first to get a good feel for what a language can do.

## PHP
PHP is a popular language that is suited to web development. If you plan to get into web development, perhaps learn javascript first due to its popularity and job availability however, you can always come to PHP if you prefer it or plan to work in it.

## Swift
Swift is a language developed by Apple primarily for creating applications for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and Linux. If you plan to develop apps primarily for Apple's products, Swift is the language to learn!

## SQL
SQL is a special query language that is used to manage data held in a database. It is widely used and if you plan to get into developing full-stack applications or even ethical hacking, SQL is an important skill to have.

## Regex
Regular expressions (regex for short) is a very small and specific language that is used to scan, search and verify text. You can use regex to verify that a user has entered a valid email or use it to replace specific portions of text that conform to a special pattern (e.g. all words ending in a question mark). It is very useful to know and makes programming in every area of the industry very useful.

## Go
Go is a language created by Google. It is designed to improve productivity in the modern day. It aims to be fast, readable and have high-performance networking and multiprocessing. It was created due to a dislike of C++ by the developers.

## Perl
Perl is a general purpose language and gained popularity for its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities. It can be used for system administration, network programming, finance and bioinformatics. It is not recommended for beginners due to its lack of available jobs and popularity in the modern day.

## Ruby
Ruby is a high level general purpose programming language developed in the 1990s in Japan. It has very unique syntax and is brilliant for string parsing and processing, just like perl, and is perfect for beginners just like Python. It has been used to create web applications used by many major companies and websites due to its Ruby on Rails framework.

## Rust
Rust is an new and incredibly fast language written in 2010 that aims to be very safe and have very few issues when run. It has been used everywhere from fire engines to web browsers like Firefox! It is similar to C++ but improves on many aspects and has a very powerful dependency management system. It is not recommended for beginners due to its more advanced syntax and concepts. 

## Dart
Dart is another Google language that is primarily used for apps on multiple platforms and can be used to build mobile, desktop, server and web applications. It has C style syntax and has very similar syntax to Javascript. It is mainly used for the Flutter tool for building mobile apps that work on both iOS and Android.

## Kotlin
Kotlin is a language designed to interoperate fully with Java. It appears to be the most preferred language of app developers on the Android platform.

## Julia
Julia is a language that can be used to write any application but mainly focusses around numerical analysis and computational science. It is very fast and can be used by beginners due to its easy enough syntax.

## Lua
Lua is a language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. It was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the incerasing demand for customization.

## Haskell
Haskell is a general purpose language that is known for being purely functional and is suitable for teaching, research and industrial application. 

## Typescript
Typescript is a language developed by Microsoft and is a strict syntactical superset of Javascript and adds static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to javascript. It is advised that you learn Javascript before Typescript but Typescript is becoming more used so you can always move onto it in the future.

## Crystal
Crystal is a language that is designed to be incredibly fast while having similar syntax to Ruby. It is good for those who want to make very fast programs without needing to learn more difficult languages like C and Rust.

## ReasonML
ReasonML is a language that lets you write simple, fast and type safe code. It integrates well with javascript and allows use of packages from their ecosystems. It allows you to make websites, animations, games, servers and cli tools.

## Nim
Nim is an efficient, expressive and elegant language that is very similar to languages like Python while being faster and providing features that lower level languages have. It is great as a stepping stone for going from python or ruby to rust or C++.

## Elixr
Elixr is a dynamic and functional language designed for beilding scalable and maintainable applications. It is designed to be fast. It can be used for web development, embedded software, data and multimedia processing. 

## Emojicode
Emoji code is a fun and esoteric language that provides all the features of most languages consisting of emojis.
